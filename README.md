# ChallengeYourOpinion
News aggregator and exploration of various media outlets

The media landscape is wide and different media outlets report differently about the same events.
One goal of this project is to highlight this, by showing the variety of opinions expressed in
various German (or Austrian, Swiss) media outlets.

One somewhat related project is improvethenews.org by Mark Tegmark.
However, here the idea is not to work with sliders and fixed categories, as one should allow the
media outlets to change (their category) over time, as viewpoints may change.

The first part of the project consists of scraping corresponding data from various websites, and
perform exploratory data analysis. In a first step, we analyze frequencies of most common words
that appear in headlines, find topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and visualize our
findings.

So far, we focus mainly on the following news outlets: nzz.ch, spiegel.de, taz.de
